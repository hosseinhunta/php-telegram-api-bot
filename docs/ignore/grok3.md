### Features (Strengths as Features)
1. **Flexible HTTP Client Support**
    - Description: Supports both cURL and Guzzle HTTP clients with user-selectable options.
    - Benefit: Users can switch between cURL and Guzzle with a simple `http_client` setting, offering high flexibility.

2. **Asynchronous Request Handling**
    - Description: Provides asynchronous request support with Guzzle using Promises for response management.
    - Benefit: Boosts speed and efficiency for projects requiring multiple simultaneous requests.

3. **Advanced Configuration Options**
    - Description: Offers advanced settings like timeout (`timeout`), retries (`retries`), and Keep-Alive (`keep_alive`).
    - Benefit: Gives users full control over request behavior, from timing to error handling.

4. **Professional Logging System**
    - Description: Implements PSR-3 logging with Monolog as the default (optional) and supports custom loggers.
    - Benefit: Detailed logging (e.g., timestamps, errors, stack traces) enhances debugging and tracking.

5. **Lightweight and Modular Design**
    - Description: A lean, modular core without prebuilt API methods.
    - Benefit: Provides a clean, extensible foundation for developers to build upon.

### To-Do List (Weaknesses as Tasks)
1. **Add Prebuilt API Methods**
    - Description: Implement ready-to-use methods like `sendMessage()`, `getUpdates()`, etc., for easier adoption.
    - Priority: High (to attract simpler use cases).

2. **Implement Async Support for cURL**
    - Description: Add asynchronous request handling for cURL using `curl_multi_init` to support users avoiding Guzzle.
    - Priority: Medium (to complete the Async feature).

3. **Create Comprehensive Documentation**
    - Description: Write detailed documentation (e.g., README) with diverse examples covering setup, configuration, and usage.
    - Priority: High (to improve user-friendliness).

4. **Add Webhook and Command Handling**
    - Description: Introduce support for Webhooks and Commands to make it more practical for real bot development.
    - Priority: Medium (optional, depending on whether you want a pure Core or a full library).

### Next Steps
- **Quick Improvement**: Start with To-Do #1 (Prebuilt Methods) and #3 (Documentation) for the biggest user impact.
- **Professional Upgrade**: Tackle To-Do #2 (Async for cURL) to polish the Async feature.
- **Bot-Focused Expansion**: Consider To-Do #4 (Webhook and Command) if you aim for full bot-building support.
