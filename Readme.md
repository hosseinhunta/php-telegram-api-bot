## Telegram Bot API - PHP SDK (Beta)

This is a PHP SDK for the Telegram Bot API, designed to make building Telegram bots as easy and fun as possible! Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this library is built with simplicity, security, and performance in mind. It comes packed with features, tons of examples, and—most importantly—a detailed documentation site that shows you just how simple it is to create Telegram bots with PHP.

We’ve worked hard to make this library a go-to tool for anyone looking to create Telegram bots without the hassle. It’s lightweight, secure, and optimized for real-world use cases, so you can focus on building your bot instead of wrestling with complicated code.

### Repository Creator's Note

Hey there! Yep, it’s me again—another Telegram bot library. But you might be wondering: why create yet another one? What’s wrong with the existing libraries? And what makes this one different?

These days, I’m going through a pretty strange phase in my life—a time when I don’t have much free time to dive into my true passion: coding. I really wanted to kick off my first GitHub repository with something meaningful, something that reflects the very first library I ever wrote. After coming back from some personal challenges (and a 12-day break), I thought, “How can I enjoy coding again while solving one of my problems?” During that time, I listened to a lot of music, and I got this idea to create a Telegram channel that could act like a playlist for me. I wanted a bot that could upload music links or files I send it as files in the channel, so I could always listen to them and share them with others. Plus, I wanted it to create a playlist for my favorite music platform.

When I started working on this with my old library, I realized how much room for improvement there was. So, I put the bot idea on hold and focused on building a better library instead. My goal? To create a comprehensive and complete library—at least a beta version—that can stand toe-to-toe with other similar libraries out there! When I say “comprehensive,” I mean it should have super clear, simple, and easy-to-understand documentation. So, I set my priorities: simplicity, security, tons of features, optimization, lots of examples, and—most importantly—a documentation site that shows everyone just how easy it is to build a Telegram bot with PHP.

Now, you might ask: why PHP? Why not Python, JavaScript, or even Dart—a language I’ve been working with a lot lately and absolutely love? Well, the first language I ever learned (at a very basic level) was PHP. Then I moved on to Python, and since the first library I ever wrote was in Python, I wanted to go back to those early days when I first fell in love with programming. So, I decided to build this with PHP. Plus, it’s a great chance to level up my PHP skills! Honestly, PHP 8.4 has made the language so much more exciting, and I’m done throwing shade at it.

As I’m writing this, I’ve got 3 days left of my break. My plan is to release a beta version in these 3 days and finally build that music bot I’ve been dreaming about. I hope this library keeps moving forward! :)
